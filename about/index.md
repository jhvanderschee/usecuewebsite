title: About me
---

My name is Joost van der Schee and I am a web developer based in Amsterdam. This harsh looking website is actually [a tribute to the web](/blog/a-tribute-to-the-web). 

I have studied Industrial Design Engineering at the [Technical University in Delft](/uploads/tudelft.jpg) and founded 'Usecue' in 2007. My first priority is my family, but my work is absolutely number two. I love what I do, which is building beautiful websites and web applications. 

All websites I build are well-coded and have good SEO. This is reflected by their excellent [Google score](/blog/google-lighthouse-score/), an objective quality measurement of a website. Quality is very important to me. I strongly believe that each job worth doing is worth doing well. Therefore I do not just build these websites, but host them as well. This supply chain integration is the reason I can deliver such high quality.

I am a big fan of Jekyll (a website generator). To help fellow Jekyll-enthusiasts, I have launched [jekyllcodex.org](http://jekyllcodex.org) and I answer Jekyll-related questions on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2397550/joosts). [CloudCannon](https://cloudcannon.com/) (an online CMS for Jekyll) mentioned me as a Jekyll expert on their '[experts page](https://cloudcannon.com/experts/)'. I was also one of the speakers on [JekyllConf 2019](https://jekyllconf.com/).

Apart from Jekyll/CloudCannon websites I also develop WordPress, Issuu, MailChimp, Shopify and custom web solutions. My latest projects include [open source invoicing software](https://www.invoicelion.org/), called 'Invoice Lion', a tool to [embed your instagram feed](https://profilepageimages.usecue.com/) on your website, called 'PPI Loader' and a [platform for producing online magazines](https://www.onlinemagazinemaker.com/), called 'Online Magazine Maker'.
