title: Great minds think alike

'Good designers copy, great designers steal', they say.

A few days ago I stumbled upon an article about [FCP monkey business](https://www.pdms.ca/improve-largest-contentful-paint-lcp-with-a-js-css-trick/) that was remarkably similar to [an article I had written](/blog/monkey-business-with-banana-leafs/) just five months ago. I confronted the author with this and he replied: 'Great minds think alike'. I believe him. 

A day later [I found a post](https://studioblanco.it/project/formafantasma) about the new website of Formafantasma, designed and built by [Studio Blanco](https://studioblanco.it/project/formafantasma). They built [a website](https://formafantasma.com) that was quite similar to [mine](/): same color palette, also lightweight, also for a company in Amsterdam and they also used Times New Roman as their main font. I really like their design. The reasoning behind it is based on [lightweight websites being green](https://www.usecue.com/nl/blog/een-groene-website/), which they extended with automatic dark-mode (smart) and tooltips for download sizes (also very nice). Although their execution could have been better (their homepage is 10 times as heavy as mine), the essence and feel of these websites is similar.

I do not know if this is 'copying', 'great minds think alike' or just a coincidence, but frankly, I do not really care. Art should not be copied, but great design should.
