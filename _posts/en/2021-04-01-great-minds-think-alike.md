title: Great minds think alike
---

Good designers copy, great designers steal.

A few days ago I stumbled upon an article about [FCP monkey business](https://www.pdms.ca/improve-largest-contentful-paint-lcp-with-a-js-css-trick/) that was remarkably similar to [an article I had written](/blog/monkey-business-with-banana-leafs/) just five months ago. The author replied: Great minds think alike. 

A day later [I found a post](https://studioblanco.it/project/formafantasma) about the new website of Formafantasma, designed and built by [Studio Blanco](https://studioblanco.it/project/formafantasma). They built [a website](https://formafantasma.com) that was quite similar to [mine](/): same color palette, also lightweight, also for a company in Amsterdam and they also used Times New Roman as their main font. I really like their design. The reasoning behind it is based on [lightweight websites being green](https://www.usecue.com/nl/blog/een-groene-website/), which they extended with automatic dark-mode and tooltips for download sizes. Unfortunately their website turns out to be 12(!) times as large/heavy as mine. Although their execution could have been better, the essence of both websites is still similar.

I do not know if this is 'copying' or 'great minds think alike'. Frankly, I do not care, as it is a compliment either way.
