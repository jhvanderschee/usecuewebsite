title: Great minds think alike
---

A few days ago I stumbled upon an article about [FCP monkey business](https://www.pdms.ca/improve-largest-contentful-paint-lcp-with-a-js-css-trick/) that was remarkably similar to [an article I had written](/blog/monkey-business-with-banana-leafs/) just five months ago. I confronted the author with this. 'Great minds think alike', he replied.

A day later [I found a post](https://studioblanco.it/project/formafantasma) about the new website of Formafantasma, designed and built by [Studio Blanco](https://studioblanco.it/project/formafantasma). They built [a website](https://formafantasma.com) that is quite similar to [mine](/): same color palette, also lightweight, also for a company in Amsterdam and they also used Times New Roman as their main font. I really like their design. The reasoning behind it is based upon the claim that '[lightweight websites are green](https://www.usecue.com/nl/blog/een-groene-website/)', which they extended with automatic dark-mode (smart) and tooltips for download sizes (also very nice). They could have mentioned [the absence of form](/blog/a-long-overdue-redesign/) and the historical reference of their design. Their technical execution could also have been better (their homepage is 10 times as heavy as mine). However, the essence and feel of their website is similar to mine and I really like the choices they made on typography and color scheme.

I do not know if this is another example of 'copying' or just another coincidence, but frankly, I do not really care. Art should not be copied, but great design should. You know what they say about designers: The good ones copy and the great ones steal. 'Great minds think alike', is the perfect answer for those situations.
