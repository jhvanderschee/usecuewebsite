title: Carousel with scroll snap
---

Scroll snap is a relative new feature in CSS, that recenty got [pretty decent support](https://caniuse.com/?search=scroll%20snap). It is 'good for nothing', if you believe [these folks in the comments](https://css-tricks.com/introducing-css-scroll-snap-points/), but that was five years ago. People were more enthusiastic about Nolan Lawsons carousel with scroll snap, he built three years later (in 2019).

Nolan inspired me to build a standard header carousel with this technique. Nolan used three components: scroll snap, smooth scroll and pinch to zoom. We do not need pinch to zoom and we also do not need to implement his second component: smooth scroll. Smooth scroll can be achieved with a single line of CSS these days. Therefore I only needed to focus on the scroll snapping, where we used almost the same code he did. However, Nolan was still worried about IE support. We are not. Therefore, we can use anchor links to smooth scroll, instead of javascript, resulting in better performance and better degredation.

Interested in the end result? Check out my [natively scrolling carousel with touch support](https://codepen.io/joosts/pen/MWJBPgo?editors=0010). It has got buttery smooth scrolling, degrades nicely and is just 3kb large.

Impressive, right? But what does this mean in the bigger scheme of things? Modern technology allows us to build smaller websites. HTML and CSS are getting more powerful. What [once](https://flickity.metafizzy.co) required 120kb of javascript, can now be achieved in under 3kb. We also have more bandwith available, faster javascript engines and faster computers. What once was deemed impossible, and was just [a fun commercial](/blog/websites-that-load-instantly), is now actually within reach: [loading a full website in 0.1 seconds](/blog/websites-that-load-instantly). Although [instantly loading websites](/blog/websites-that-load-instantly) have better reach, better conversion, and a better user experience, this is not the way things are moving on average. On average, websites are getting [bulkier every year](https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight), allowed by the [ever increasing available bandwidth](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/law-of-bandwidth/) and, as argued, the variation is getting larger. 

Today you have a choice: do you want an oversized and obese piece of nostalgia, or a blazing fast and lightweight marvel of modern technology?
