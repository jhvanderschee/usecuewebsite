Anonymous warned Elon Musk. Elon believes technology will save our planet, while he invested heavily in (and profitted from) the most poluting business on earth today: the bitcoin.

Hypocrazy like that is exactly what baffles Greta Tunberg. I just watched her speak at TED and her words hit me like a hammer: There is no hope. Not unless we change our behaviour right now. There are no rules against burning coal and oil to generate a virtual currency. The earth, however, is sacficed for this virtual wealth. Real wealth does not come from a bitcoin or from electric cars (and most certainly not from flying to Mars). Greta reminds us that real wealth is honouring human rights, biodiversity and taking care of the world we live in.
