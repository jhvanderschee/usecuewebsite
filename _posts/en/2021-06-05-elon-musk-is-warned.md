title: Elon Musk has been warned

Anonymous has warned Elon Musk. Elon has been telling us that technology will save our planet, while he recently invested heavily in (and profitted from) the most poluting business on earth today: the bitcoin. That has infuriated quite some people.

Hypocrazy like that (and at this scale) is exactly what baffles Greta Tunberg. I just watched her speak at TED and her words hit me like a hammer: There is no hope. Not unless we change our behaviour and or our legislations right now. There are no rules against burning coal and oil to generate a virtual currency and Elon Musk has taken advantage from that in a disgusting way. He inspired a bitcoin run so large, GPU processing power (the main ingredient for bitcoins, next to fossil fuels) have tripled in price. Can you imagine the amount of fossil fuels that are wasted every second to acquire wealth in this nasty way? Do you realize that the earth is sacficed for this virtual wealth? Great reminds us that real wealth is created by honouring human rights, biodiversity and taking care of the world we live in... and nothing else. And that we are all part of the problem, as long as we are not part of the solution. 

I hope they will be easy on Elon, because revenge has never brought anyone anything good. However... they might just want to send a clear signal and impose fear, which seems justified to me, as these are crucial times.
