Peter is a poet, storyteller, puppeteer and theatre maker. Over 5 years ago I installed an Envato WordPress theme for him. That theme was not repsonsive and used WP Touch to display a mobile website (with limitations). He asked me to update his website. I rebuild his theme in Jekyll and connected the CloudCannon CMS. I also transformed his pixel logo into vectors, rewrote all javascript, made the theme responsive and added a little webshop (including product presentations). Peter was very pleased with the end result and not unimportant: so was I! This website will easily last another 5 years.
