Peter Vermaat is a poet, storyteller, puppeteer and theatre maker. Five years after I set him up with an [popular Envato WordPress theme](/uploads/rockwell.jpg), he asked me to update his website. I rebuild his (outdated) theme in Jekyll and connected the [CloudCannon CMS](https://cloudcannon.com/). I also transformed his pixel logo into vectors, rewrote all CSS and javascript, made the theme responsive and added a webshop (including product presentations). This updated website will easily last another five years.
