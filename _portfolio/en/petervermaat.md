Peter Vermaat is a poet, storyteller, puppeteer and theatre maker. Five years after I installed [an Envato WordPress theme](https://themeforest.net/item/rockwell-portfolio-blog-wordpress-theme/249087) for him, he asked me to update his website. I rebuild his (outdated) theme in Jekyll and connected the CloudCannon CMS. I also transformed his pixel logo into vectors, rewrote all javascript, made the theme responsive and added a webshop (including product presentations). Peter was very pleased with the end result and not unimportant: so was I! This website will easily last another five years.
