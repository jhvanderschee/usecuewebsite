I designed and built this [instantly loading website](/blog/websites-that-load-instantly/) for my father. The website showcases his milestones and publications as a professor at the VU University Amsterdam. Pages load in under 0.2 seconds from anywhere in the world, are only 77kb large and have a perfect Google score. The website is partly static and partly Jekyll and is available in two languages. He can update his website easily through the CloudCannon CMS.
